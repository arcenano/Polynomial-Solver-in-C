The program at hand is intended to find the roots of a polynomial function.

Instructions for Use:

Input a function of x in the form: CoefficientxPower+CoefficientxPower-Numberc.

For example: f(x) = x+3.00x6-3324.00x4+5390.00x9-5.00c

If the function has a constant number, a c must be entered after it.

Where every coefficient has two decimal places.

The function can be as long as 100 Characters, and have powers of x up to 10.

The highest coefficient or constant number allowed is 9999.99.

The program will then ask for a range to look for roots of x, any range may be inputted.

The program finds the  roots inside the range, and if there are none then it computes the nearest root.

If the  function has no real roots, then the program will alert so.
